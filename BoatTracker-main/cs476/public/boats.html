                        <p>The Melges C Scow was the first class of scow built by Harry Melges, Sr. in 1945.<br>
                            It quickly became known for cerebral, tactical skills being central to success on<br>
                            the water. Inspired by more than 100 years of competitive racing, this cat-rigged,<br>
                            maneuverable sailboat is great fun and a total pleasure to sail. <br><br>
                            A modern, versatile and easy-to-sail boat, it accommodates 2-3 crew and is super-charged<br>
                            with a large, powerful mainsail. Built with integrity, the Melges C Scow is fast and<br>
                            calibrated superlatively for speed. It is one of the most friendly and popular classes<br>
                            in the Melges Scow family, producing as many as 80+ boats on the starting line.</p>
