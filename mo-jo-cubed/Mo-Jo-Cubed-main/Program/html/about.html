                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <h3>In 2022, Gang Green was founded with a simple mission, build a cool website that you'd use to decide whether a Steam game was worth buying</h3>

                    <p>When our team was recently formed, we had a vision. A vision to create a cool website. We appreciated the reviews that people left on games,
                        and we wanted to give other people easy access to it.</p>
                    <p>But the knowledge at the time was very limited - Code would break (it still does at times), links wouldn't work, and the website format would
                        get a little messy. Not only was it a major blockade for us, but it also limited our growth as a team. And that frustration led us to a solution. </p>
